# Codeforces-Performace-Analyser
The website uses Codeforces API. Try it out here: [www.contestanalyser.codes](http://www.contestanalyser.codes/)

* It provides a medium to analyse all the contests given by you, by building a Performance Report of the Selected Contest.
* It provides some basic stats of the contest, and several statements based on your performance compared with others __relatively__. It also suggests problem tags to be practiced, and puts forward some random facts related to the contest.

It also uses charts to provide deeper insights to the problems of the selected contest.

*You are requested to visit the website on larger screen size for a better experience.*(Currently, there are limited features, but I am planning to add more, and will also make it mobile responsive.)

PS: (At the time I was working on this website, I realized that it is not so easy to create a general algorithm which can be used to measure performance of people with such different skill sets... But, I gave my 100% efforts to provide something useful to everyone :-)
